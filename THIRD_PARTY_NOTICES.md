The macOS app may read Tailscale status icon resources **at runtime** from a
separately installed `/Applications/Tailscale.app`. These assets are not included
in this repository or release archive. When that app is absent, Tailnet Bridge
draws its own fallback icon. The Dock icon in this project is locally generated
by `Resources/GenerateAppIcon.swift` and has a distinct green dot.

Tailscale, INCY, and Happ are independent products. Their names are used only
to identify compatibility. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by
